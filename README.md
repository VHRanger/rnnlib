# rnnlib
A library for recurrent neural networks in [Dlang](https://dlang.org/)

The aim of this project is to build a RNN factory such that one can construct
RNN architecture using simple layers and any non linear function.

The neural networks will primarily be trained using [Evolutionnary Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm).
The reason why we do not use any optimization based on gradient descent is to avoid many issues it gives us when optimizing
a rnn like vanishing/exploding gradients (e.g. see _[On the difficulty of training recurrent neural networks](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/pascanu13.pdf)_).

One of the auxiliary goal of this project is to cut any dependencies between the evolutionary algorithms
and the recurrent neural netwroks to enable anyone to use it independently.

## Daily Todo
* Think about parameters shared between layers: can the layer be different and share the same parameters ?
* (optm) randclone weigths: serialized_data holds all weigths -> can be constructed using smaller array with random cloning.
